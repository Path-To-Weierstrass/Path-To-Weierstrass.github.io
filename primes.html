            <h3>Introduction to Prime Numbers</h3>
            <p>Prime numbers are often referred to as the building blocks of the natural numbers. But what exactly are they?</p>

            <p>A <strong>prime number</strong> is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means that a prime number cannot be divided evenly by any other number except for 1 and the number itself. For example, the number 7 is prime because it can only be divided by 1 and 7.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, numbers like 6 are <strong>not</strong> prime, because they can be divided by other numbers as well—specifically, 1, 2, 3, and 6.</p>

            <p>So, what does a list of prime numbers look like? The first few primes are quite simple to spot: <strong>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19</strong>. These numbers are all prime because none of them can be divided by anything other than 1 and themselves.</p>

            <p>But primes don’t stop here. They continue indefinitely, and there's no simple pattern to predict them (though mathematicians have found interesting ways to approximate where the next prime might be). In fact, the search for large primes continues to be an exciting area of research, with practical applications in fields like cryptography.</p>

            <h3>Why Are Prime Numbers Important?</h3>
            <p>Prime numbers might seem like just a curious mathematical concept at first, but they have far-reaching implications. For example, they play a critical role in <strong>cryptography</strong>, which is the science of securing information. The security of many modern encryption systems relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into primes.</p>
